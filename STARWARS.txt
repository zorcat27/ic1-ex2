I enjoy the Star Wars universe more because it was what I grew up with.
My Dad started showing my older brother and I the first movies on LaserDisc
when I was only a few years old. Since then, I've enjoyed the movies, some of
the books, and a few of the games. Star Trek is cool, but not what I grew
up with.
