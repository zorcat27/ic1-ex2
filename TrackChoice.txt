I chose Computer Engineering because computers have always fascinated me.
When I was young, my parents purchased a basic Windows PC. We played various
learning games and eventually started playing other games. In the process,
we needed more power, so my parents bought the computer parts and had our
close family friend build us new computers. I was probably around 8 when
this happened and this close friend let us help. It was a fun experience.
Since then, I've always been using computers for school and play. I like
to joke that I learned how to type by playing Runescape and later World
of Warcraft. I was very young when I started, so I didn't want to use 
my voice. So instead, I got really good at typing quickly.

When I was working for a small HVAC company, I learned that I didn't enjoy
the business side of my job, but I really enjoyed learning about the technical
aspects of the HVAC equipment. I decided that I wanted to learn a skill where
I could design products that would help people and solve problems. When it came
to picking a specific engineering major, I already knew that I wasn't mechanic-
ally inclined, so I thought I would look into electrical and computer engineer-
ing. In the process, I learned about the differences between the two, and my
previous experience with computers growing up made it an easy choice. I'm
very glad that I chose computer engineering. It has been a perfect major for
me.
